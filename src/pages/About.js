        <h1> ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
        The Fine Pixel was born out of the simple idea of loving what you do - following your soul – and, of course, our love for puns (sold/ souled). Our philosophy is just as simple- life is short, don’t spend it doing something you don’t like. From our products to our website, from our office culture to the way we interact with our customers, this philosophy’s a part of everything we do.


In August 2020, The Fine Pixel was founded by two people, with just a cupboard full of spiral diaries (probably as big as yours).

The Neighbourhood Store Vibe
We aspire to be your favourite, friendly neighbourhood store. We curate all your favourite designs and make them available on various products ranging from spiral diaries, mugs, and hardbound diaries to phone covers, stickers, notebooks, and more. We’re always enthusiastic and kicked about interacting with everyone- whether it’s handling queries over email and social media or interacting with our fans at various events, workshops, and stalls. Why? Because we care. A recent study by our in-house, prize-winning, and totally unbiased researchers showed that visiting our instagram causes excessive happiness, and could increase your lifespan by up to 7.5%.

All of this for YOU
We help you express yourself through our wide collection of products available online. The collection is extensive and features menswear and womenswear. Our t-shirts online reflect the latest trends. We have official merchandise for Hollywood and Bollywood movies, your favourite TV shows, as well as top sports teams- there’s something for everyone! With your love and support, The Souled Store has grown to over 1 million fans on Facebook, 200,000 followers on Instagram and the numbers are growing as we type this. We’re grateful to have you as a part of our journey to spread love to more and more Souledsters all over.

Our Ethos
While we are a fun loving, pop culture brand, as a company that interacts so actively with various people from diverse backgrounds, we have a larger, more responsible role to play. We try and lend support to a variety of causes that we are passionate about and do our bit to give back.
<br/>
<br/>
Most recently, we launched a campaign in collaboration with GiveHer5, a social initiative, to provide safe, affordable sanitary solutions to women in rural areas. We worked enthusiastically to design a wide range of merchandise, featuring themes of female empowerment, feminism, and gender equality, to raise funds and fight period poverty. Every t-shirt sold = 1 girl’s yearly requirement of sanitary napkins. Through sustained efforts of the GiveHer5 team and with the help of a lot of celebrities who lent their support, we were able to help over 1,000 girls and women, a number we’re super proud of!
